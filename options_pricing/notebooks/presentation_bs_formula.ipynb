    "We we use a model with two type of assets : \n",
    "- Risky asset : a stock denoted by $S$\n",
    "- Risk free asset : a bond, a bank account ('Livret A') ... denoted $B$ with a short interest rate $r$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these assets to build a portfolio $h(x,y)$ where $x$ is the number of risk free asset and $y$ is the number of risky asset. \n",

    "A financial derivative or contingent claim is financial product whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset. The derivative is a contract between parties (in general two) and its value is determined by the value of the underlying asset.\n",

    "In our case, the underlying asset will be the risky asset $S$ and we will denote $\\mathcal{X}$ the contingent claim where the time to the maturity of the contract is denoted $T$. It means that at time $T$ it will be possible to determine the amount of money to be paid out. And this price is determine by the contract function $\\Phi$ such that : \n",
